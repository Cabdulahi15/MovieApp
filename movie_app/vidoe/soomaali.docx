00:00:18.475 --> 00:00:20.431
Outfit X
A private terrorist group

00:00:20.933 --> 00:00:23.904
They work on contract,
not for ideological reasons

00:00:24.068 --> 00:00:25.080
We have a red flag

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.584
They're planning a massive attack
And their target is India

00:00:30.981 --> 00:00:34.140
An attack that India
could not even imagine

00:00:34.591 --> 00:00:37.001
This isn't a negotiation,
it's an ultimatum

00:00:38.262 --> 00:00:39.949
And your time starts...

00:00:42.541 --> 00:00:43.470
now!

00:00:44.069 --> 00:00:44.918
What next?

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:48.571
The time for Pathaan's exile
is over

00:00:51.512 --> 00:00:53.228
If you have a party
at Pathaan's house,

00:00:55.352 --> 00:00:57.062
he'll greet you

00:01:02.317 --> 00:01:03.906
with fireworks

00:01:17.099 --> 00:01:18.816
I'm a soldier, Pathaan,
like you

00:01:20.123 --> 00:01:22.071
We can take on
this mission together

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:23.772
So are you in?
Or are you out?

00:01:35.006 --> 00:01:37.933
Pathaan, the hunter
Hunted?

00:01:45.072 --> 00:01:45.909
Let's go

00:02:01.057 --> 00:02:03.829
Give your Mother India
my last goodbye

00:02:07.388 --> 00:02:10.137
A soldier does not ask
what his country can do for him

00:02:10.586 --> 00:02:13.508
He asks what he can do
for his country

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.981
Jai Hind!
